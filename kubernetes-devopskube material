GKE has two types of clusters.

Autopilot Cluster: All cluster infrastructure operations are taken care of by Google cloud. You just have to focus on application deployments.
Standard Cluster: Here except for the control plane, you have to manage the underlying infrastructure (Nodes, scaling etc)




DevOps (a clipped compound of development and operations) is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers 
and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.


Every company will have a logging and monitoring infrastructure. Commonly used logging stacks are Splunk and ELK. Also, there are few SaaS companies like Loggly, 
which provide logging infrastructure.

For monitoring, there are open source tools like Prometheus, Nagios and enterprise tools like AppDynamics, Datadog, SignalFx, etc. Check out our blog on the best 
open source monitoring tools.
