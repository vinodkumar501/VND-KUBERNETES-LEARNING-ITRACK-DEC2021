GKE has two types of clusters.

Autopilot Cluster: All cluster infrastructure operations are taken care of by Google cloud. You just have to focus on application deployments.
Standard Cluster: Here except for the control plane, you have to manage the underlying infrastructure (Nodes, scaling etc)




DevOps (a clipped compound of development and operations) is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers 
and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.


Every company will have a logging and monitoring infrastructure. Commonly used logging stacks are Splunk and ELK. Also, there are few SaaS companies like Loggly,
